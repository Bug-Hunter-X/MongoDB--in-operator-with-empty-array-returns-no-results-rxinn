# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The `$in` operator is typically used to match documents where a field's value exists within a specified array.  However, when the array is empty, the query returns no results instead of returning all documents, as might be intuitively expected.

## Problem

The incorrect usage of `$in` with an empty array leads to unexpected behavior.  The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` should ideally return all documents in the collection, but instead, it returns an empty array.

## Solution

To correctly handle situations where you might have a dynamically generated empty array, consider using alternative approaches like this:
* Check if the array is empty before constructing the query.
* Use the `$or` operator for flexibility.
* Consider using $exists operator to check the existence of the field.

The solution provided demonstrates these alternatives, providing a robust and more predictable query behavior.
